### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Dirtimoney. Working on building my understanding of secruity auditing and security practices. I have a background in CompSci that focuses on traditioal Web2.0 securtiy and Pen-testing. Now I am looking to focus on Web3.0 and the challeneges that poses for security minded people and the possible vulnerabilties that are presented.

- :dragon: Enjoy math, Computer Science, Science, Space, really anything that teases the imagination, oh and gaming :grinning:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://www.smartcontract.engineer/challenges ; https://cryptozombies.io/ ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ (Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript â€“ 32-Hour Course)
- :triangular_ruler: I am learning and listening to as many personnel in the field as possible to include Mudit Gupta YouTube channel ; CoinSec Podcast ; Patrick Collins
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how my previous training in C++, JS, VB, SQL, Python can carry over into the Web3.0 space and help with my understanding of Solidity. I will be focused on learning Smart Contract Auditing and better ways to learn it as right now finding material that is in a digestible model for someone who learns with hands on examples and with feedback mechanisms.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning and understanding Smart Contract Auditing.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with additional resources that are available but readily able to find.
- :star2: Enjoy learning new things even if they are not relavent to my current area of study. Constantly looking for interesting useless knowledge lol
