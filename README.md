### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Dirtimoney. Working on enhancing my skillset in vulnerability assessment/penetration testing/security analysis. I have a M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance


- :dragon: Enjoy math, Computer Science, Science, Space, really anything that teases the imagination, oh and gaming :grinning:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TCM-Security Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) [https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/], Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) [https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/], Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT) [https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjwt/], Practical Junior IoT Tester (PJIT) [https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjit/], CISSP. I am also in the process of building a home lab using Proxmox.

- :triangular_ruler: I am learning and listening to as many personnel in the field as possible to better understand the challeneges and changes to the security landscape to better understand and apply pen-testing methodology and toolsets.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently honing how my previous training in C#, JS, Python, Powershell, Linux, Unix and how each respective language fits into Pen-Testing arena with automation of repetitive tasks, parsing datasets, and the vulnerabilities introduced with different languages. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to expand and develop my skillset further into advanced areas such as Malware analysis,  reverse engineering, software exploitation, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis.

- ðŸ¤” Currently building a master list of training resources and information guides/books/etc to have 1 location for available information in Cyber Security (or Cybersecurity depending on your flavor :D). Iâ€™m looking for help with additional resources that are available but not always readily available to find. I have noticed that it is very spread out.

- :star2: Enjoy learning new things even if they are not relavent to my current area of study. Constantly looking for interesting areas that could intersect the same space.
