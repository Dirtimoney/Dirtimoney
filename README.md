### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Dirtimoney. Working on building my understanding of secruity auditing and security practices. I have a background in CompSci that focuses on securtiy and Pen-testing. 


- :dragon: Enjoy math, Computer Science, Science, Space, really anything that teases the imagination, oh and gaming :grinning:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TCM-Security Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT), Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT), CISSP.

- :triangular_ruler: I am learning and listening to as many personnel in the field as possible to better understand the challeneges and changes to the security landscape to better understand and apply pen-testing methodology and toolsets.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently honing how my previous training in C++, JS, VB, SQL, Python can carry over into the into the Pen-Testing arena with automation of repetitive tasks, parsing datasets, and the vulnerabilities introduced with different languages. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to expand and develop my skillset further into advanced areas such as Malware analysis,  reverse engineering, and how to sandbox malicious items to analyze them.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with additional resources that are available but readily able to find.

- :star2: Enjoy learning new things even if they are not relavent to my current area of study. Constantly looking for interesting areas that could intersect the same space.
